## Some things I believe:

- **AGI is on the horizon...**
  - Humanity is called to create AGI
  - Current transformer-based architectures automate knowledge tasks but do not naturally lead to human-level general intelligence (AGI)
  - AGI may require new architectures and algorithmic breakthroughs beyond our current understanding

- **Language is the map, not the territory**
  - Language-based learning is a top-down approach that may be inherently limited
  - Bottom-up, embodied approaches such as world models are likely critical to achieving true intelligence
  - Living organisms learn through bottom-up interaction with their environment, not through language or observation alone
  - Language is the icing on the cake

- **The bridge matters less than who it carries across**
  - Technology is for people
  - Better technology does not de-facto mean a better society
  - We must be thoughtful about the technology we build
  - Simple solutions are often the best solutions
  - User experience matters more than flashy features

- **Knowledge wants to free**
  - Collaboration accelerates progress
  - Transparency builds trust
  - Give back to the community that helped you grow

- **Simplicity is sophistication**
  - Complex problems often have elegant solutions
  - Good design is invisible
  - Less is more when done thoughtfully
